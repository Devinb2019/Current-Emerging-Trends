Briefly explain the work you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I was provided with foundational code to set up the environment and data structures necessary for building a reinforcement learning model. My contribution focused on developing an intelligent agent that interacts with this environment. Specifically, I implemented the code enabling the agent to learn and adapt using reinforcement learning principles, optimizing its actions over multiple epochs to increase performance and accuracy within the simulated environment.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize algorithms and systems that process information efficiently. Their work powers advancements in technology across various fields, from artificial intelligence to network security. By enabling complex problem-solving and improving system efficiencies, computer scientists contribute to technological progress that impacts daily life, business operations, and scientific research.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist typically involves breaking down the problem into manageable components, analyzing data and requirements, and designing algorithms or models that solve the issue effectively. Experimentation and iteration play significant roles, as does a structured problem-solving approach that often starts with understanding the end goal, planning the solution design, implementing, testing, and refining based on feedback or performance metrics.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the solutions I develop are reliable, safe, and respectful of user privacy and organizational data integrity. Ethical considerations encompass not only data protection but also transparency and fairness, ensuring that algorithms do not unintentionally discriminate or cause harm. Balancing innovation with responsibility is key to fostering trust and reliability in technology.
